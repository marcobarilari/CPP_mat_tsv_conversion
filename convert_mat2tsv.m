function convert_mat2tsv(mat_file,TR)
%% This function takes an SPM ONSET MAT file and converts it to a tab-seperated (TSV) file
% The scripts extracts the conditions' names, onsets, and durations.
% The scripts takes the onsets and durations (in TR units) and converts
% them to seconds by MULTIPLYING the onsets/durations by the TR.
